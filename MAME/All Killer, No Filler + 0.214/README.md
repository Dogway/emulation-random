## **All Killer, No Filler +**

This is my MAME sorting list based on the original "All Killer, No Filler", it's based on version 0.214.

I include sorting scripts for 914 MAME split roms, divided in:
`775 MAME games`
`61 ports (MS, MD, NES, SNES)`
`74 BIOS`
`6 required parents`
`31 disc images (CHD)`

They are sorted by genre for which I added more games to _vsfighting and _vertshmups, and added new genres like _racing, _shooter, or _ports. Some few gems were lacking in the original list to be honest.

I exclude games from the following systems because I consider them important enough to be on their own and basically use their whole romset:

CPS2, CPS3, NeoGeo, Hyper NeoGeo 64, Viper, Hornet, Zinc, Model 2, Model 3, Hikaru, Gaelco, Atomiswave, Naomi (1,2,GD,GD 2) and Namco (10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 23, 246, 256)
