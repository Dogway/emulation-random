# MAME - HLSL Settings

Per driver/board HLSL settings, I initially made them with the [Nueda's INI_Creator_v0.4](https://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=45026&start=870), but then modified them extensively on a per board basis.
It's designed for 1080p displays so not sure how it would look on 4K.

*By the way I use groovymame but IIRC it shouldn't present a problem with vanilla MAME.
