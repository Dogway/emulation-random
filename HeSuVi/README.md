# HeSuVi - Cycle Profiles (AHK Script)


Script to Cycle through HeSuVi profiles with hotkeys AND raise or lower output master volume.

Notification is in audio file format (place Audio folder inside "..\HeSuVi\hrir" folder) so it doesn't interrupt with fullscreen applications in Exclusive Presentation mode.


I only include 4 profiles to cycle through:
- cmss_game (for games)
- dh++ (for movies)
- dtshx2+ (for movies or games, a darker flavour) (download from [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/hesuvi/discussion/general/thread/108490f54e)
- stereo (for comparison) (renamed from "none")
