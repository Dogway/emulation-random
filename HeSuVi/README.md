# HeSuVi - Cycle Profiles (AHK Script)


Script to Cycle through HeSuVi profiles with hotkeys AND raise or lower output master volume.

Notification is in audio file format (place Audio folder inside "..\HeSuVi\hrir" folder) so it doesn't interrupt with fullscreen applications in Exclusive Presentation mode.


I only include 5 profiles to cycle through:
- cmss_game (for games)
- dts_hpx_oe_bal (for games, a bit darker) (download from [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/hesuvi/discussion/general/thread/108490f54e))
- dts_hpx_oe_spac (for movies, room) (download from [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/hesuvi/discussion/general/thread/108490f54e))
- dh++ (for movies, theater)
- stereo (for comparison) (renamed from "none")
