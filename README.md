# Emulation Files

Here I collect random files I created in regard to emulation. They span from simple per-game configuration files, to AutoHotkey based scripts for display presentation or databases for different aspects of correct game reproduction (correct aspect ratio, PAL optimization, internal widescreen or PAL60 support, etc)
